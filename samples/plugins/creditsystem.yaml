# Configuration for the Creditsystem-plugin.                 #
##############################################################
# The Creditsystem allows you to credit for kills or other   #
# events like carrier landings. You can use it with a custom #
# lua command in your own missions also.                     #
# Some other plugins can work with these credits, like for   #
# instance the SlotBlocking-plugin, that can block slots by  #
# credits.                                                   #
