# Plugin MessageOfTheDay (MOTD)
This plugin adds a message of the day to the server, that is displayed either on join or when you hop into a plane.

## Configuration
The plugin is configured via yaml, as many others. If you don't generate your custom yaml file (sample available in the 
samples directory), the plugin will not generate any messages.

To be able to create a message on "birth", MISSION_STATISTICS = true has to be enabled on your server.

```yaml
DEFAULT:
  on_birth:                   # message will fire when someone enters a plane
    report: greeting.json     # the respective report will be used (see Reporting Framework)
    display_type: popup       # the message will generate a popup ..
    display_time: 20          # .. which lasts for 20 seconds
  nudge:
    delay: 3600               # the following message will be displayed every 3600 seconds (1h)
    message: "This awesome server is presented to you by http://discord.gg/myfancylink.\n
      Come and join us!"
    recipients: '!@everyone'  # the message only goes to specific recipients (see below)
    display_type: chat        # the message will be displayed in the in-game chat
DCS.openbeta_server:
  on_join:                    # The message will be displayed in the in-game chat on join of the server.
    message: Welcome to our public server! Teamkills will be punished.
```
> recipients can be a list of Discord groups that the player either is part of or not (prepend with !).<br>
> !@everyone means, this message is for people that are not a member of your Discord.

If you want to play sounds, make sure that you loaded them into the mission first (see [MizEdit](../../extensions/MizEdit.md)).

### Optional Layout for multiple Recipient Groups
```yaml
      nudge:
        delay: 60
        messages:
        - message: This awesome server is presented to you by https://discord.gg/myfancylink.\nCome and join us!
          recipients": "!@everyone"
          display_type: popup
          display_time: 20
        - message": Glad to have you guys here!
          recipients: DCS Admin
          display_type: popup
          display_time: 20
```
