# Plugin ServerStats
If you enable this plugin you will gather statistics for your DCS servers.<br>
This can be helpful to detect issues in your servers and missions or just to see how many people love which of your missions most.

## Configuration
As ServerStats is an optional plugin, you need to activate it in main.yaml first like so:
```yaml
opt_plugins:
  - serverstats
```

The plugin itself does not need a configuration. You can specify an optional configuration though, which can be used 
to monitor the server FPS:
```yaml
DEFAULT:
  min_fps: 30       # minium acceptable FPS (0 = disabled)
  period: 5         # period of 5 minutes (default = 5)
  mentioning: true  # mentioning DCS Admin (default = true)
  message: "The FPS of server {server.name} are below {min_fps} for longer than {period} minutes!"
```
