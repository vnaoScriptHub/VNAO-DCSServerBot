# Plugin "Mission"
The mission plugin adds commands for amending the mission list, persistent mission- and player-embeds to be displayed 
in your status channels and ATIS like information for the missions' airports. 

## Uploading of Missions
You can upload .miz files in the configured admin channel of your server(s). Existing missions will be replaced (with 
security question) and if the server is running with that mission, it will be restarted (another security question 
will apply). Newly added missions will be auto-added to the mission list.<br>

You can configure the behaviour of the mission upload feature with an optional config/plugins/mission.yaml:
```yaml
DEFAULT:
  uploads:          # Configure how mission uploads are handled
    enabled: true   # Here you can disable the feature at all (default: true = enabled)
    discord:
      - DCS Admin   # Define which roles are allowed to upload missions (default: DCS Admin)
```


## Auto-Scanning
If you set `autoscan: true` in your server configuration of your servers.yaml, all miz files that were added into the 
Missions folder of your DCS-server (for instance via a Google Drive) will be auto-added to your mission list.
